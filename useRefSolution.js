The issue is that you're trying to access the ref before it's been properly assigned by React.  To solve this, use the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array.  This ensures the code within the `useEffect` only runs after the component has mounted:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Access the ref here after the component has mounted
    if (myRef.current) {
      console.log('Ref is available:', myRef.current);
      // Perform actions using myRef.current
    }
  }, []);

  const handleClick = () => {
    // This will now work correctly
    if (myRef.current) {
       console.log('Ref in handleClick:', myRef.current);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
      <Button title="Click Me" onPress={handleClick} />
      <View ref={myRef}>
        <Text>This is the ref element</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

By wrapping the ref access within the `useEffect` hook and using an empty dependency array, we guarantee that `myRef.current` will contain the DOM element before any attempts are made to use it.
